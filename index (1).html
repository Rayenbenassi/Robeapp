              <h2 class="font-weight-bold">How does a help desk app work?</h2>
              <p>A help desk is a resource intended to provide the customer or end user with information and support related to a company's or
                 institution's products and services. The purpose of a help desk is usually to troubleshoot problems
                 or provide guidance about products such as computers, electronic equipment, food, apparel, or software. Corporations usually provide 
                 help desk support to their customers through various channels such as toll-free numbers, websites, instant messaging, or email.
                  There are also in-house help desks designed to provide assistance to employees.

              <p>    End-users need someone to turn to when comes to technical glitches and quick responses can increase user satisfaction.
                 While you may believe your staff is not flooded with issues, there are times where you may not know how busy they are or who 
                 is putting in the extra time. Regardless, the help desk staff must have the ability to quickly respond to tickets to keep the 
                 organization moving forward.
                
                Your  team needs to be able to understand the issue and have a resource to turn to that allows them to walk the user through 
                a process and get a solution. That is why a help desk app becomes so vital to your success.

                They can notice which tickets are more important or urgent and can help with resolving those problems first.

                A good help desk software system can separate technical issues from the non-technical ones. This ensures that the right our staff are
                 dealing with the most difficult technical problems. It also helps your business track what types of issues are coming in. This helps
                  you efficiently handle different types of issues with your staff and allows you to identify
                 and correct the problems moving forward or have systematized ways of handling them when they arise.</p>

              <h3>Proactive Help Desk Solutions </h3>
              <p>One of the benefits of hiring  professionals is that they come up with proactive solutions without having to depend on anyone.
                 A mobile app almost guarantees the help desk staff will have the ability to manage and provide effective, timely solutions. 
                 Effective, timely solutions are so important because users want quick solutions so they can move on with whatever it is they have to do.

                Employees value their time as much as you do. The more businesses show they value the time of their staff, the more loyal the staff
                 will be. Staff needs the ability to hit a button that lets them get in touch with the technical department of your business in an
                  instant. This allows them to seek resolutions to their problems instead of feeling as though they are at the mercy of the department.
                   This reduces
                 frustration and allows users to be more willing to listen to the solutions your experts are providing..</p>

              <h3> Odd Hour Help Desk Support .</h3>
              <p>Another reason a mobile help desk app is useful is that someone can be available at any time to help.
                 Instead of having to pay an IT department to be fully staffed 24 hours per day, especially on weekends, 
                 staff can use the app as needed. The app helps show business staff that they will have support for their needs any time, 
                 day or night. It also helps create a happier environment for IT employees, since they are not as tied to their computers.
                 A mobile app provides help desk support with both freedom and flexibility..</p>

              <p>our professionals have the tools to provide effective solutions to user issues a lot quicker. Yet, it’s not realistic for many companies 
                to hire a large  department to handle technical issues. This is why a mobile app can be so effective. If you have a handful of the staff,
                 these professionals will still have the capability to respond to tickets anytime from any location. This mean
                 that even on the worst days when the phone seems to be ringing off the hook, there are options where someone with the right tools can help..</p>

                    Most computers today are designed to turn off automatically if any of its inner components overheat.
                     Often, heat-related issues occur when the computer is working hard, e.g., playing a graphically intense computer game or editing a video.
                     Start by verifying the fan on the power supply is working by examining the back of the computer. The fan should be moving quickly and
                      smoothly. All other fans in the computer require you to open the computer case to inspect them. Once inside your computer, examine the
                       processor (heat sink), video card, and case fans. 
                     If any abnormal noises have come from your computer (e.g., high squealing sound or low grinding sound), it could indicate a malfunctioning 
                     fan.

                    Reboot
                   If your computer has not been rebooted recently, make sure to reboot it before following any of the steps below. Rebooting the 
                    computer can fix many problems and is an easy first step.
                    Background programs
                    One of the most common reasons for a slow computer is programs running in the background. Remove or disable any TSRs and startup programs 
                    that automatically start each time the computer boots.
                    Tip
                   To see what programs are running in the background and how much memory and CPU they are using, open Task Manager. If you are running Windows 
                      7 or higher, 
                      run Resmon to get a better understanding of how your computer resources are used.

                    Software related issue
                    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by software related issues. If you are encountering lockups when the computer is 
                    opening a particular program, make sure you have all 
                    the latest updates for all running programs. You can find the latest updates for your software through the software developer or publisher.
                    Too many programs open
                  Each program or window you open on your computer takes some of the computer's resources to keep it running. If you have too many programs open 
                  at one time, your computer may be low on 
                  resources, and as a result, is freezing. Try only running one program at a time to make sure your freezing is not being caused by multiple 
                  programs running at the same time.

                    Verify the diskettes or CD are readable by reading the files from the drive. For example, Microsoft Windows users can explore the drive 
                    in Windows Explorer. If the CD attempts 
                    to AutoPlay, you may need to right-click the drive and click Explore to browse the drive. If you are having problems with reading a CD,
                    If the CD reads fine with no errors, verify your computer meets the minimum requirements of the game. If your computer does not have enough 
                    disk drive space or does not meet the requirements, the game may not install.
